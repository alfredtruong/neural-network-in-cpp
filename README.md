### DISCLAIMER
- I followed in [Cr4ckC4t's](https://github.com/Cr4ckC4t/neural-network-from-scratch) footsteps to 
- reimplement [Jason Brownlee's](https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/) python implementation in C++ 
- purely for learning purposes

### DETAILS
- I [started](https://github.com/alfredtruong/neural-network-in-python) by going through [Jason's](https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/) implementing it in Python to make sure I understood what needs to be done in C++
- I followed a bit what [Cr4ckC4t](https://github.com/Cr4ckC4t/neural-network-from-scratch) and then diverged as I got more comfortable with my own repo

### RESULT
- my code works
- training error
  - accuracy = 0.985714
  - sum of square errors = 5.24968

### FUTURE WORK
- reimplement weights with `array` rather than `vector`?
- implement multiple activation functions
- configurable number of hidden layers
- allow regression as well as classification
